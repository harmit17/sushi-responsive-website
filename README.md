# Responsive Website using HTML and CSS with animations

## Description
This repository contains a responsive website created using HTML and CSS. The project was developed as part of the youtube learning project by JavaScript Mastery course(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRrPE9aj3wI).The objective of this project was to practice and refine my knowledge in HTML and CSS. 

## Key Learnings
In the process of working on this project, I gained valuable insights and skills, including:
- **CSS Variables:** Utilized CSS variables to enhance flexibility and maintainability.
- **Importing CSS Files:** Learned how to import CSS files into other CSS files for modular styling.
- **Creating Smooth Animations:** Implemented smooth and subtle animations to enhance user experience.
- **BEM Naming Method:** Applied the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming convention for more structured and maintainable CSS.
- **File and Folder Organization:** Maintained a well-organized file and folder structure for efficient development.
